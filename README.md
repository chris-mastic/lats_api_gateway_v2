## Overview
lats-api-gateway_v2 is an API gateway that provides users with access to internal data and a remote API along with certain data item persistance. Users authenticate against the remote
API, receive an auth token and query and make changes to internal data before posting those changes along with the auth token, back to the remote API.

• Queries and returns data from an internal database to the frontend
• Persists certain user data in a separate database
• Forwards user changes to a remote API

• IFramework.EntityFrameworkCore.Blueshift.MongoDB version 2.2.2

## Data Flow
1. User enters credentials.
2. Credentials are sent to remote API.
3. An authorization token is generated and received from remote API.
4. Token is stored in local MongoDb and used to maintain state.
